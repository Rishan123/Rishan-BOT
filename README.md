# Rishan-BOT
A robot that sees and recognises objects using a Raspberry Pi and Machine Learning.
I recommend checking out the Tensorflow web page. Some of the code will be from tutorials such as this one: 

# Installation
``` sudo pip3 install wrapt --upgrade --ignore-installed ```


``` sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt ```
